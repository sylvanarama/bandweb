          <p>Born in Montreal, Quebec, Wolf has been writing and performing music for over twenty five years, starting out with punk rock bands in the late 80s and then metal in the 90s and 2000s. In between he managed to acquire degrees in classical and contemporary art music where he specialized in composition and theory. Having grown up listening to folk music, he always sang and played songs by popular American artists until finally settling on the Celtic, specifically Irish, street ballads for his choice of interpretation, He began by leading the group Knackers Yard for a number of years, then co-founded Dark Island, Peatfire Flame and finally The Hounds of Cuchulain. Wolf currently writes music for contemporary classical organizations worldwide, performs regularly with The Hounds and is currently writing an album of original folk song.</p>
