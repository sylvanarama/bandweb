    <h2>About the Band</h2>
</div>

<div style="width:80%; margin:auto;"
  <p style="font-weight:lighter; text-align:left; margin:auto;">
    The Hounds of Cuchulain are a four-piece folk band who perform a wide selection of Irish, Scottish, English, and original songs in the Celtic tradition: rowdy pub songs, tender ballads, spirited dance tunes, and ancient airs played with an authenticity and energy which brings the tradition to life for any occasion. <br><br>

    The group is led by seasoned performer and composer Wolf Edwards on lead vocal and guitar; and joined by long running musical partner Devo Bernard on the 5-string banjo; the multi-talented Madeleine Townley on vocals, Irish harp, and tin whistle; and by the virtuoso fiddler and master of harmony Briana Kennedy. <br><br>
    
    Combining powerful vocals, driving guitar, classic irish banjo, inventive harmonies on the fiddle, sprightly leads on the whistle, as well as bold and bright accompaniment on the harp, the Hounds bring passion and life to the tradition of celtic music - creating a full-blooded, genuine folk character that is not to be missed!

    <h3 style="font-size:1.5rem;">About the Name</h3>
    <p style="font-weight:lighter; text-align:left; margin:auto;">
    The band takes their name from the Celtic myth of Setanta who, after slaying the guard hound of the blacksmith Culann in self defense, offered to take the fierce dog's place until he could raise another. Thereafter Setanta became known as Cuchulain or “the hound of Culann” - and the dog that he raised was the “Hound of Cuchulain”! Having Irish, Scottish, English, and Welsh heritage, the band felt it an appropriate name as it connects us with our music of the past. <br><br>
    
     Irish Wolfhounds, which Culann’s hound most likely was, were bred for war as fast and fierce hunters - but in the home they are loyal and gentle, enjoying lounging by the hearth. To us, the image of the Wolfhound is emblematic of the history and variety of folk music: as a call to action, a racing reel, or music to bring to mind home, hearth, and good company!
